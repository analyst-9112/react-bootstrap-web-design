                            Our guide,  Chris, was *fantastic.* He was super friendly, knew the river and the  history of the area ridiculously well, and made running the rapids super  smooth (of course, this included the calculated runs into the smooth  boulders to spin the boat around, and diving us headfirst into the big  waves in the rapids to get us all wet, "surfing" as much as we could  that also involved getting completely soaked - it was great!). We  stopped wherever we could - jumped off ~10-foot rocks (at two different  spots!), sat in the warm "Queen's bath", picked blackberries.
